1. Please read the honour code and type your name below by ignoring Turkish characters.

2. While there may be a lot of reading to do on a problem, there is relatively little code to write, so please take the time to read each problem and **the hints** carefully.

3. Please make sure that your code runs and does what you expect it to do before submitting. You can use the test cases we provide but you should also come up with additional test cases of your own. 

4. If you see **an empty repl** when you accept the assignment, first refreh the page. If that does not work, then delete the repl and accept the assignment again. If it still does not work, raise your hand and we will be there to help you.

5. There is a solution file in each question for your solutions. Even if you work on a solution in `main.py` or some other temp area or file, please do not forget to copy your code and answers to allocated areas in `q[1-3].py` files.

6. If you use an unauthorized source (See the Honour Code for a list of authorized sources) to solve a question, cite it as a comment in the area allocated to your solution, e.g. the link to a website.

7. Note that any function or code fragment that you write will be judged not only on correct functionality, but also on clarity and good programming practice.

8. Please do not speak without raising your hand. Talking, messaging, sharing screen are not allowed.

9. When you have a question, please raise your hand and the instructor or a TA will be there to help you.

10. There are 3 questions in the exam and you will have 180 minutes in total to solve them. You can start from any question you want.

11. Do not forget to commit and push your work before the end of the exam, i.e. 18:00. It is your responsibility to commit **before that time**. Late commits will not be accepted.

12. If the commit&push button on repl.it does not work, then first download your work, then delete the repl, accept the assignment again, copy your work into the new repl, and try to do the commit&push. If that does not work, then raise your hand, and we will be there to help you.

Good luck!
