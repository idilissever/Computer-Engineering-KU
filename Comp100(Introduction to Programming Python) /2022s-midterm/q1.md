## Secure Passwords (20 points)
In this question, assume that a mobile app development company hires you, and your first task is to implement a password checker for an app. Towards this goal, you are given a set of requirements which define a valid password. A valid password:

* consists of minimum 8, maximum 15 characters
* does not include the same character repeating such as `"aa",  "111"` 
* includes at least one special character from ones of the following characters: `',' '!', '@', '#', '?', '.'`
* does not include three consecutive numbers such as `"a123fgdg!", "456x.koma"`. Alternatively, `"a591fgdg!"`is acceptable. 
* has at least an uppercase character but it cannot be the first or the last character.

Implement a function called `check_password(pw)`, which takes a string password `pw` as input and returns `True` if it is a valid password and `False` otherwise according to the requirements above. Note that a valid password needs to satisfy **all of  reqirements**. In case of an invalid password, make sure to print **all of the errors** to signal what is wrong with the password.
