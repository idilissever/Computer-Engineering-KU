## Bouncing Ball (20 points)
Azra is a 5-year-old girl who loves little bouncing balls. 
She saw a vending machine in the mall and insisted on a new pinky one. 
After getting the ball, she starts to play with it cheerfully to see how far it can go. 

Let's assume that we are only interested in the **horizontal displacement** of the ball. Since there is some fraction caused by the surface, the ball will move slower at each bounce, and stop at some point. 

Your task as her sister/brother is to find out how far the ball can go in the x-direction, given an initial `step_size` in **cm**, and `fraction` as a floating point number. 

**Hint:** To check if the ball stopped, let's define a threshold of `step_size = 1 mm` where any changes smaller than it will be neglected. In other words, we assume that the ball stopped if the step_size is smaller than 1 mm. 

**Example:**

If the initial `step_size=5`, and `fraction=0.5`, the jumps would result in these displacements:
```
Jump 1: 5
Jump 2: 2.5
Jump 3: 1.25
Jump 4: 0.625
Jump 5: 0.3125
Jump 6: 0.15625
Jump 7: 0.078125 (Ignored, ball is assumed as still)  
```

You do not need to print every jump, the output simply would be:
```
Total horizontal displacement: 9.84375
```
